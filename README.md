# RestockIT
An android app to handle your house storage

## Descriprion
With this app you can manage your home pantry like a smart warehouse.

I often don't know what to buy when I'm in the supermarket. Well, since I created this app it doesn't happen to me anymore, **the app remembers it for me automatically**.

When you click on the plus button on the bottom-left corner you can scan a product to either _**register**_, _**add**_ or _**remove**_ a product for your **smart warehouse**

## Features:
- Everyting works with barcodes (easy, fast and reliable)
